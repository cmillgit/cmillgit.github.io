Hello and welcome to my personal webpage! I’m Christian, a soon-to-be Economics graduate from the University of Oklahoma with a passion for data analysis and a drive to apply modern technology to solve and understand real-world problems. My academic journey has been characterized by a dedication to developing analytical and problem-solving skills, which have laid a solid foundation for my career aspirations in analytics and consulting. This dedication has been rewarded with a place on the President's Honor Roll and a streak of academic excellence I'm proud to maintain.

Last summer, I embarked on a learning journey with R programming, which culminated in an empirical project analyzing the impacts of historical events on airfares using fixed-effects regression. This experience, along with my other coursework and my senior capstone project analyzing international cartels, has honed my skills in data analysis, visualization, and modeling—skills I'm eager to apply in the professional world.

Outside the classroom, I'm an avid cook with a particular love for traditional Mexican cuisine, a fitness enthusiast, and a self-proclaimed music aficionado. My German Shepherd, Lily, my hobbies, and the support of my friends and loved ones are what keeps me going!

After gaining industry experience, I plan to further my education in a graduate program, believing that real-world application will guide my selection of specialized study. My traits as a problem solver, relationship builder, communicator, and advocate for diversity are what I believe make me a valuable asset in any role. My journey hasn't been without its challenges; overcoming personal and academic obstacles has instilled in me resilience, a fresh perspective on adversity, and an understanding of the value of health, relationships, and self-improvement.

What sets me apart is not just analytical thinking or my academic credentials, but my life's journey—overcoming significant personal challenges, fostering meaningful connections, and achieving academic success against the odds. Today, I am ready to embark on a professional journey, driven by the desire to leverage my skills, experiences, and insights to drive innovation, efficiency, and positive change.
